Unlike functions, closures have access to variables that are defined within the scope
in which the closure is defined

FnOnce, FnMut, Fn
FnOnce: consumes the variables it captures from its enclosing scope, known as the closureâ€™s environment.
FnMut: can change the environment because it mutably borrows values.
Fn: borrows values from the environment immutably.
